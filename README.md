# Zendesk to BigQuery Sync üîÑ
## Project Description üì∞
Zendesk to BigQuery Sync is a Python application designed to **synchronize Zendesk data into Google BigQuery efficiently**. This project was created to address the slow synchronization process of an existing connector. The project includes two versions:

- **Interactive Application**: A GUI-based app that prompts users for their credentials before starting the synchronization.
- **Script Version**: A command-line script where users can input their login information directly into the code. <br>

This project is currently under development. Find the documentation [here](https://github.com/RobinNoiret/Connector_ZendeskBigQuery/blob/986e59d9083749909d9630985a24e82ca984eaa9/Documentation/Doc_PyConnector.md)

## Prerequisites ‚ö†
The project requires the following Python libraries:

- zenpy
- pandas
- pandas_gbq

### Installation Instructions
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

` pip install zenpy \  
pip install pandas \  
pip install pandas-gbq `

## Usage Instructions üíª
be sure to locate the script file using the **cd** command in the terminal.

### Interactive Application
1. Run the GUI application:

` python tkinterApp.py `

2. Enter your Zendesk email, API token, subdomain, and ticket status.
3. Click the "Start!" button to begin the synchronization process.

### Script Version
1. Open the script file and enter your Zendesk credentials directly in the code.
Run the script:

` python connectorZendeskBigQuery.py `

## Configuration ‚öô
Currently, the project supports only one authentication method. Additional authentication methods are planned for future development.

## Troubleshooting üî®
- Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- Verify that your Zendesk credentials are correct.
- Check your internet connection if data retrieval or pushing to BigQuery fails.
