# Zendesk to BigQuery Sync üîÑ

## Project Description üì∞
Zendesk to BigQuery Sync is a Python application designed to **efficiently synchronize Zendesk historical data into Google BigQuery**. This project was created to address the slow synchronization process of an existing connector. It includes different codes that complement each other to make the complete solution work.

This project is currently under development. Find the documentation [here](https://github.com/RobinNoiret/Connector_ZendeskBigQuery/blob/986e59d9083749909d9630985a24e82ca984eaa9/Documentation/).

## Prerequisites ‚ö†
The project requires the following Python libraries:

- json
- csv
- pandas
- google.cloud
- os

### Installation Instructions
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install google.cloud-bigquery
```

## Usage Instructions üíª
Make sure to locate the script file using the cd command in the terminal.

os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = r'Your_credential_path'
```
